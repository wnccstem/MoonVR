"""
Frame caching system for unreliable wireless camera streams.
Buffers frames from upstream and serves them with a configurable delay.

This system acts as a "buffer" between an unreliable wireless camera and web browsers.
It downloads frames from the camera, stores them temporarily, and serves them to browsers
with a slight delay. This smooths out connection problems and provides stable video.
