    Media Relay Class - The Smart Video Distributor
    
    Think of this like a cable TV splitter for video streams:
    - It connects to the camera ONCE
    - Multiple web browsers can watch the same stream
    - If the camera goes offline, it automatically tries to reconnect
    - It removes slow clients so they don't affect others
    
    This is much more efficient than having each browser connect directly
    to the camera, which would overwhelm it.
    
    Why we need this:
    - Cameras can usually only handle a few connections at once
    - If 10 people try to watch, the camera might crash
    - The MediaRelay acts as a "middleman" that shares the stream
